@body

`can-connect` includes behaviors that:

Load data:

 - [can-connect/data/url/url data/url] —
    Persist data to RESTful or other types of HTTP services.

 - [can-connect/data/parse/parse data/parse] —
    Convert response data into a format needed for other extensions.

Convert data into special types:

 - [can-connect/constructor/constructor constructor/] —
    Create instances of a provided constructor function or list type.

 - [can-connect/constructor/store/store constructor/store] —
    Prevent multiple instances of a given id or multiple lists of a given set from being created.

Keep lists updated with the most current data:

 - [can-connect/real-time/real-time real-time] —
    Lists updated when instances are created or deleted.

Implement caching strategies:

 - [can-connect/fall-through-cache/fall-through-cache fall-through-cache] —
    Use [connection.cacheConnection cache] data if possible when creating instances,
    then update the instance with server data upon completion of a background request.

 - [can-connect/cache-requests/cache-requests cache-requests] —
    Cache response data and use it for future requests.

 - [can-connect/data/combine-requests/combine-requests data/combine-requests] —
    Combine overlapping or redundant requests.

Provide caching storage (as a [connection.cacheConnection cacheConnection]):

 - [can-connect/data/localstorage-cache/localstorage-cache data/localstorage-cache] —
    LocalStorage caching connection.

 - [can-connect/data/memory-cache/memory-cache data/memory-cache] —
    In-memory caching connection.

Glue certain behaviors together:

 - [can-connect/data/callbacks/callbacks data/callbacks] —
    Add callback hooks are passed the results of the DataInterface methods (CRUD operations).

 - [can-connect/data/callbacks-cache/callbacks-cache data/callbacks-cache] —
    Handle [can-connect/data/callbacks/callbacks data/callbacks] and update the [connection.cacheConnection cache]
    when CRUD operations complete.

Provide convenient integration with CanJS:

 - [can-connect/can/map/map can/map] —
    Create [can-define/map/map] or [can-define/list/list] instances from responses. Adds connection-aware
    methods to configured types.

 - [can-connect/can/ref/ref can/ref] - Handle references to other instances in the raw data responses.  

 - [can-connect/can/merge/merge can/merge] - Minimize updates to deeply nested instance data when new data is
    returned from the server.

 - [can-connect/can/constructor-hydrate/constructor-hydrate can/constructor-hydrate] - Always check the
    instanceStore when creating new instances of the connection Map type.

`can-connect` also provides several other non-behavior utilities for connection ease of use in CanJS:
 - [can-connect/can/super-map/super-map] — Create a connection for [can-define/map/map can-define/map] or
    [can-define/list/list can-define/list] types using nearly all behaviors.

 - [can-connect/can/model/model] — Create [can-map] types that emulate the interface of
    [can.Model](http://v2.canjs.com/docs/can.Model.html). Used for CanJS 2.x migrations.

 - [can-connect/can/tag/tag] — Create a custom element that can load data into a template.


## Overview

The `can-connect` module exports a `connect` function that is used to assemble different behaviors (plugins)
and some configuration options into a `connection`.  For example, the following uses `connect` and the
[can-connect/constructor/constructor constructor/constructor] and [can-connect/data/url/url data/url] behaviors
to create a `todoConnection` connection:

```js
import connect from "can-connect";
import constructor from "can-connect/constructor/";
import dataUrl from "can-connect/data/url/";

const todoConnection = connect(
	[ constructor, dataUrl ],
	{ url: "/services/todos" }
);
```

A typical connection provides the ability to create, read, update, or delete (CRUD) data hosted by some data
source. Those operations are usually performed via the connection [can-connect/InstanceInterface InstanceInterface]
methods:

 - [can-connect/connection.get]
 - [can-connect/connection.getList]
 - [can-connect/connection.save]
 - [can-connect/connection.destroy]

For example, to get all todos from "GET /services/todos", we could write the following:

```js
todoConnection.getList( {} ).then( function( todos ) { /* ... */ } );
```

__Behaviors__, like [can-connect/constructor/constructor constructor/constructor] and [can-connect/data/url/url data/url]
implement, extend, or require some set of [interfaces](#Interfaces).  For example, [can-connect/data/url/url data/url]
implements the [can-connect/DataInterface DataInterface] methods, and [can-connect/constructor/constructor constructor/constructor] implements
the [can-connect/InstanceInterface InstanceInterface] methods.

The `connect` method arranges these behaviors in the right order to create a connection. For instance, the
[can-connect/cache-requests/cache-requests cache-requests] behavior must be applied after the [can-connect/data/url/url data/url]
connection.  This is because [can-connect/cache-requests/cache-requests cache-requests], overwrites [can-connect/data/url/url data/url]’s
[can-connect/connection.getListData connection.getListData] method to first check the cache for the data.  Only if the
data is not found, does it call [can-connect/data/url/url data/urls]’s [can-connect/connection.getListData].

This behavior arranging makes it so even if we write:

```js
import dataUrl from "can-connect/data/url/";
import cacheRequests from "can-connect/cache-requests/";
connect( [ cacheRequests, dataUrl ] );
```

or

```
connect([dataUrl, cacheRequests])
```

... the connection will be built in the right order!

A __connection__ is just an object with each specified behavior on its prototype chain and the passed options object
at the end of the prototype chain.


### Basic Use

When starting out with `can-connect`, it’s advisable to start out with the most basic behaviors:
[can-connect/data/url/url data/url] and [can-connect/constructor/constructor constructor/constructor].
[can-connect/data/url/url data/url] adds an implementation of the [can-connect/DataInterface DataInterface] that connects to a RESTful data source.
[can-connect/constructor/constructor constructor/constructor] adds an implementation of the [can-connect/InstanceInterface InstanceInterface]
that can create, read, update and delete typed data via the lower-level [can-connect/DataInterface DataInterface].

By "typed" data we mean data that is more than just plain JavaScript objects.  For example, we want might to create
`Todo` objects that implement an `isComplete` method:

```js
import assign from "can-assign";

const Todo = function( props ) {
	assign( this, props );
};

Todo.prototype.isComplete = function() {
	return this.status === "complete";
};
```

And, we might want a special `TodoList` type with implementations of `completed` and `active` methods:

```js
const TodoList = function( todos ) {
	[].push.apply( this, todos );
};
TodoList.prototype = Object.create( Array.prototype );

TodoList.prototype.completed = function() {
	return this.filter( function( todo ) {
		return todo.status === "complete";
	} );
};

TodoList.prototype.active = function() {
	return this.filter( function( todo ) {
		return todo.status !== "complete";
	} );
};
```

We can create a connection that connects a RESTful "/api/todos" endpoint to `Todo` instances and `TodoList` lists like:

```js
import connect from "can-connect";

const todoConnection = connect( [
	require( "can-connect/constructor/constructor" ),
	require( "can-connect/data/url/url" )
], {
	url: "/todos",
	list: function( listData, set ) {
		return new TodoList( listData.data );
	},
	instance: function( props ) {
		return new Todo( props );
	}
} );
```

and then use that connection to get a `TodoList` of `Todo`s and render some markup:

```js
const render = function( todos ) {
	return "<ul>" + todos.map( function( todo ) {
		return "<li>" + todo.name +
        "<input type='checkbox' " +
        ( todo.isComplete() ? "checked" : "" ) + "/></li>";
	} ).join( "" ) + "</ul>";
};

todoConnection.getList( {} ).then( function( todos ) {
	const todosEl = document.getElementById( "todos-list" );
	todosEl.innerHTML = "<h2>Active</h2>" +
    render( todos.active() ) +
    "<h2>Complete</h2>" +
    render( todos.completed() );
} );
```

The following demo shows the result:

@demo demos/can-connect/basics.html

This connection also lets you create, update, and destroy a Todo instance as follows:

```js
const todo = new Todo( {
	name: "take out trash"
} );

// POSTs to /api/todos with JSON request body {name:"take out trash"}
// server returns {id: 5}
todoConnection.save( todo ).then( function( todo ) {
	todo.id; //-> 5
	todo.name = "take out garbage";

	// PUTs to /api/todos/5 with JSON request body {name:"take out garbage"}
	// server returns {id: 5, name:"take out garbage"}
	todoConnection.save( todo ).then( function( todo ) {

		// DELETEs to /api/todos/5
		// server returns {}
		todoConnection.destroy( todo ).then( function( todo ) {

		} );
	} );
} );
```

### Behavior Configuration

Whenever `connect` creates a connection, it always adds the [can-connect/base/base base] behavior.
This behavior is where the configuration options passed to `connect` are stored and it also defines
several configurable options that are used by most other behaviors.  For example, if your backend
uses a property named `_id` to uniquely identify todos, you can specify this with
[can-connect/base/base.idProp idProp] like:

```js
import constructor from "can-connect/constructor/";
import dataUrl from "can-connect/data/url/";
const todoConnection = connect(
	[ constructor, dataUrl ],
	{
		url: "/api/todos",
		idProp: "_id"
	}
);
```

Behaviors list their configurable options in their own documentation pages.  

### Behavior Overwriting

If the configuration options available for a behavior are not enough, it's possible to overwrite any
behavior with your own behavior.

For example, [can-connect/constructor/constructor constructor/constructor]’s
[can-connect/constructor/constructor.updatedInstance updatedInstance] method sets the instance’s
properties to match the result of [can-connect/connection.updateData updateData]. But if the
`PUT /api/todos/5 {name:"take out garbage""}` request returns `{}`, the following example would
result in a todo with only an `id` property:

```js
const todo = new Todo( { id: 5, name: "take out garbage" } );

// PUTs to /api/todos/5 with JSON request body {name:"take out garbage"}
// server returns {}
todoConnection.save( todo ).then( function( todo ) {
	todo.id; //-> 5
	todo.name; //-> undefined
} );
```

The following overwrites [can-connect/constructor/constructor constructor/constructor]’s
implementation of `updateData`:

```js
import constructor from "can-connect/constructor/";
import dataUrl from "can-connect/data/url/";
const mergeDataBehavior = {
	updateData: function( instance, data ) {
		Object.assign( instance, data );
	}
};

const todoConnection = connect( [
	constructor,
	dataUrl,
	mergeDataBehavior
], {
	url: "/api/todos"
} );
```

You can add your own behavior that can overwrite any underlying behaviors by adding it to the end
of the behaviors list.


### CanJS use

If you are using CanJS, you can either:

- use the [can-connect/can/map/map can/map] behavior which provides many connection methods and
  settings to integrate closely with [can-define/map/map can-define/map] and
  [can-define/list/list can-define/list] types.

- use the [can-connect/can/super-map/super-map can/super-map] helper to create a connection that
  bundles [can-connect/can/map/map can/map] and many of the other behaviors.

Using [can-connect/can/map/map can/map] to create a connection looks like:

```js
import DefineMap from "can-define/map/map";
import DefineList from "can-define/list/list";
import dataUrl from "can-connect/data/url/url";
import constructor from "can-connect/constructor/constructor";
import constructorStore from "can-connect/constructor/store/store";
import canMap from "can-connect/can/map/map";

const Todo = DefineMap.extend( { /* ... */ } );
Todo.List = DefineList.extend( {
	"#": Todo
} );

const todoConnection = connect(
	[ dataUrl, constructor, constructorStore, canMap ],
	{
		Map: Todo,
		url: "/todos"
	}
);
```

Using [can-connect/can/super-map/super-map] to create a connection looks like:

```js
import DefineMap from "can-define/map/";
import DefineList from "can-define/list/";
import superMap from "can-connect/can/super-map/";

const Todo = DefineMap.extend( { /* ... */ } );
Todo.List = DefineList.extend( {
	"#": Todo
} );

const todoConnection = superMap( {
	Map: Todo,
	url: "/todos"
} );
```

<!--- todo: move this explanation of constructor/store somewhere better --->

Both the above connections contain the [can-connect/constructor/store/store constructor/store] behavior.
This means when you create a binding to a `Todo` or `Todo.List` instance, they will automatically
call [can-connect/constructor/store/store.addInstanceReference constructor/store.addInstanceReference]
or [can-connect/constructor/store/store.addListReference constructor/store.addListReference].
[can-connect/constructor/store/store constructor/store] then retains the instance for the life
of the binding and ensures only single shared instance of a particular piece of data exists. This
prevents a common programming problem where multiple copies of an instance are held by parts of
an application that loaded the same data.

### Other use

Integrating `can-connect` with another framework is typically pretty easy.  In general, the pattern involves creating
a behavior that integrates with your framework’s observable instances. The [can-connect/can/map/map can/map] behavior
can serve as a good guide. You’ll typically want to implement the following methods in your behavior:

`.instance` - Creates the appropriate observable object type.
`.list` - Creates the appropriate observable array type.
`.serializeInstance` - Return a plain object out of the observable object type.
`.serializeList` - Return a plain array out of the observable array type.  

`.createdInstance` - Update an instance with data returned from `createData`.
`.updatedInstance` - Update an instance with data returned from `updateData`.
`.destroyedInstance` -  Update an instance with data returned from `destroyData`.
`.updatedList` - Update a list with raw data.

And, in most frameworks you know when a particular observable is being used, typically
observed, and when it can be discarded.  In those places, you should call:

- [can-connect/constructor/store/store.addInstanceReference] — when an instance is being used.
- [can-connect/constructor/store/store.deleteInstanceReference] — when an instance is no longer being used.
- [can-connect/constructor/store/store.addListReference] — when a list is being used.
- [can-connect/constructor/store/store.deleteListReference] — when a list is no longer being used.

## Creating Behaviors

To create your own behavior, call `connect.behavior` with the name of your behavior and a function that returns an
object that defines the hooks you want to overwrite or provide:

```js
connect.behavior( "my-behavior", function( baseConnection ) {
	return {

		// Hooks here
	};
} );
```

For example, creating a basic localStorage behavior might look like:

```js
connect.behavior( "localstorage", function( baseConnection ) {
	return {
		getData: function( params ) {
			const id = this.id( params );
			return new Promise( function( resolve ) {
				const data = localStorage.getItem( baseConnection.name + "/" + id );
				resolve( JSON.parse( data ) );
			} );
		},
		createData: function( props ) {
			const id = localStorage.getItem( baseConnection.name + "-ID" ) || "0";
			const nextId = JSON.parse( id ) + 1;

			localStorage.setItem( baseConnection.name + "-ID", nextId );
			return new Promise( function( resolve ) {
				props[ this.idProp ] = nextId;
				localStorage.setItem( baseConnection.name + "/" + nextId, props );
				resolve( props );
			} );
		},
		updateData: function() { /* ... */ },
		destroyData: function() { /* ... */ }
	};
} );
```
