 * Adds an interface to interact with custom types via the connection instead of plain Objects and Arrays.
 *
 * @signature `constructor( baseConnection )`
 *
 * Adds an interface that allows the connection to operate on custom types. These fall into the categories:
 * - [can-connect/constructor/constructor#CRUDMethods CRUD Methods] - create, read, update and delete typed instances via the data source
 * - [can-connect/constructor/constructor#CRUDCallbacks CRUD Callbacks] - activities run on typed instances following data source operations
 * - [can-connect/constructor/constructor#Hydrator Hydrators] - conversion of raw data to typed data
 * - [can-connect/constructor/constructor#Serializers Serializers] - conversion of typed data to raw data
 *
 * @param {{}} baseConnection `can-connect` connection object that is having the `constructor` behavior added
 * on to it.
 *
 * @return {Object} A `can-connect` connection containing the method implementations provided by `constructor`.
 *
 * @body
 *
 * ## Use
 *
 * The `constructor` behavior allows you to instantiate the raw representation of the data source's data into a
 * custom typed representation with additional methods and behaviors.

 * An example might be loading data from a `"/todos"` service and being able to call `.timeLeft()`  on the todos that
 * you get back like:
 *
 * ```
 * todoConnection.get({id: 6}).then(function(todo){
 *   todo.timeLeft() //-> 60000
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * The following creates a `todoConnection` that does exactly that:
 *
 * ```
 * // require connection plugins
 * var constructor = require("can-connect/constructor/");
 * var dataUrl = require("can-connect/data/url/");
 *
 * // define type constructor function
 * var Todo = function(data){
 *   // add passed properties to new instance
 *   for(var prop in data) {
 *    this[prop] = data;
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * // add method to get time left before due, in milliseconds
 * Todo.prototype.timeLeft = function(){
 *   return new Date() - this.dueDate
 * };
 *
 * // create connection, passing function to instantiate new instances
 * var todoConnection = connect([constuctor, dataUrl], {
 *   url: "/todos",
 *   instance: function(data){
 *     return new Todo(data);
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The `constructor` behavior is still useful even if you want to keep your data as untyped objects (which is the
 * default behavior when no [can-connect/constructor/constructor.instance `instance`] implementation is provided).  The
 * behavior provides an interface to the data held by the client. For example,
 * [can-connect/constructor/constructor.updatedInstance] provides an extension point for logic that needs to be executed
 * after an instance held by the client finishes an update request. This is valuable whether that instance is typed or not.
 * Extensions like [can-connect/real-time/real-time] or [can-connect/fall-through-cache/fall-through-cache]
 * require this interface for advanced behavior.
 *
 * ## Interface
 *
 * `constructor` provides the following categories of methods to interact with typed data:
 *
 * ### <span id="CRUDMethods">CRUD Methods</span>
 *
 * Methods that create, read, update and delete (CRUD) typed representations of raw connection data:
 *
 * - [can-connect/constructor/constructor.get] - retrieve a single typed instance from the data source
 * - [can-connect/constructor/constructor.getList] - retrieve a typed list of instances from the data source
 * - [can-connect/constructor/constructor.save] - save a typed instance's data to the data source
 * - [can-connect/constructor/constructor.destroy] - delete a typed instance's data from the data source
 *
 * ### <span id="CRUDCallbacks">CRUD Callbacks</span>
 *
 * "CRUD Methods" call these methods with request response data and a related instance. Their implementation here
 * updates the related instance with that data:
 *
 * - [can-connect/constructor/constructor.createdInstance] - after [can-connect/constructor/constructor.save saving] new instance to data source, update that instance with response data
 * - [can-connect/constructor/constructor.updatedInstance] - after [can-connect/constructor/constructor.save saving] existing instance to data source, update that instance with response data
 * - [can-connect/constructor/constructor.destroyedInstance] - after [can-connect/constructor/constructor.destroy deleting] instance from data source, update that instance with response data
 * - [can-connect/constructor/constructor.updatedList] - after new data is read from the data source, update an existing list with instances created from that data
 *
 * ### <span id="CRUDMethods">Hydrators</span>
 *
 * These methods are used to create a typed instance or typed list given raw data objects:
 * - [can-connect/constructor/constructor.hydrateInstance] - create a typed instance given raw instance data
 * - [can-connect/constructor/constructor.hydrateList] - create a typed list of typed instances given given raw list data
 *
 * ### <span id="Serializers">Serializers</span>
 *
 * These methods convert a typed instance or typed list into a raw object:
 * - [can-connect/constructor/constructor.serializeInstance] - return raw data representing the state of the typed instance argument
 * - [can-connect/constructor/constructor.serializeList] - return raw data representing the state of the typed list argument
 *

		 *
		 * @body
		 *
		 * ## Use
		 *
		 * To use `save` to create an instance, create a connection, then an instance, and call `.save()` on it:
		 *
		 * ```
		 * // Create a connection
     * var constructor = require('can-connect/constructor/');
		 * var dataUrl = require('can-connect/data/url/');
		 * var todoConnection = connect([dataUrl, constructor], {
		 *   url: "/todos"
		 * });
		 *
		 * // Create an instance
		 * var todo = {name: "do dishes"};
		 *
		 * // Call .save()
		 * todoConnection.save(todo)
		 * ```
		 *
		 * `.save(todo)` above will call [can-connect/data/url/url.createData `createData`] on the [can-connect/data/url/url]
		 * behavior, which will make an HTTP POST request to `/todos` with the serialized `todo` data.  The server response
		 * data may look something like:
		 *
		 * ```
		 * {
		 *  id: 5,
		 *  ownerId: 9
		 * }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * That data will be passed to [can-connect/constructor/constructor.createdInstance] which by default
		 * adds those properties to `todo`, resulting in `todo` looking like:
		 *
		 * ```
		 * {
		 *  name: "do dishes",
		 *  id: 5,
		 *  ownerId: 9
		 * }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * As an example of updating an instance, change a property on `todo` and call `.save()` again:
		 *
		 * ```
		 * // Change a property
		 * todo.name = "Do dishes now!!";
		 *
		 * // Call .save()
		 * todoConnection.save(todo)
		 * ```
		 *
		 * The `.save(todo)` above will call [can-connect/data/url/url.updateData `updateData`] on the
		 * [can-connect/data/url/url] behavior, which will make an HTTP PUT request to `/todos` with the serialized `todo`
		 * data.
		 *
		 * A successful server response body should look something like:
		 *
		 * ```
		 * {
		 *  name: "Do dishes now!!",
		 *  id: 5,
		 *  ownerId: 9
		 * }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * This data will be passed to [can-connect/constructor/constructor.updatedInstance] which by default sets
		 * all of `todo`'s properties to look like the response data, even removing properties that are missing from the
		 * response data.

		 * @property can-connect/constructor/constructor.instance instance
		 * @parent can-connect/constructor/constructor.options
		 *
		 * Behavior option provided to create a typed form of passed raw data.
		 *
		 * @signature `connection.instance( props )`
		 *
		 * Creates a typed instance for the passed raw data object. This method is passed as an option to the connection.
		 * Called by [can-connect/constructor/constructor.hydrateInstance].
		 *
		 * @param {Object} props a raw object containing the properties from the data source
		 * @return {can-connect/Instance} the typed instance created from the passed `props` object
		 *
		 * ### Usage
		 *
		 * The following example makes the connection produce `Todo` typed objects including a `complete` method:
		 *
		 * ```
		 * var constructor = require("can-connect/constructor/");
		 * var dataUrl = require("can-connect/data/url/");
		 *
		 * // define type constructor
		 * var Todo = function(rawData){
		 *   // add raw data to new instance
		 *   Object.assign(this, rawData);
		 * };
		 *
		 * // add methods to custom type
		 * Todo.prototype.complete = function(){
		 *   this.completed = true;
		 * }
		 *
		 * // create connection
		 * var todosConnection = connect([constructor, dataUrl], {
		 *   url: "/todos",
		 *   instance: function(rawData) {
		 *     return new Todo(rawData);
		 *   }
		 * });
		 *
		 * // use connection to get typed instance & use custom method
		 * todosConnection.get({id: 5}).then(function(todo){
		 *   todo.completed; // false
		 *   todo.complete();
		 *   todo.completed; // true
		 * });
		 * ```
		 *
