 *
 * Overwrites `baseConnection` so it contains a store for instances and lists.  This behavior:
 * - extends the [can-connect/constructor/store/store.hydrateInstance] and
 * [can-connect/constructor/store/store.hydrateList] methods to return instances or lists from the store, if available
 * - overwrites "CRUD" methods to make sure that while requests are pending, new lists and instances have references
 * kept in the store. This prevents duplicated instances from being created during concurrent requests.
 * - provides methods to add and remove items in the store by counting references
 *
 * @param {{}} baseConnection `can-connect` connection object that is having the `constructor/store` behavior added
 * on to it. Should already contain a behavior that provides the InstanceInteface
 * (e.g [can-connect/constructor/constructor]). If the `connect` helper is used to build the connection, the behaviors
 * will automatically be ordered as required.
 *
 * @return {Object} a `can-connect` connection containing the method implementations provided by `constructor/store`.
 *
 * @body
 *
 * ## Use
 *
 * The `constructor-store` behavior is used to:
 *  - provide a store of instances and lists in use by the client
 *  - prevent multiple instances from being generated for the same [can-connect/base/base.id] or multiple
 *    lists for the same [can-connect/base/base.listSet].
 *
 * The store provides access to an instance by its [can-connect/base/base.id] or a list by its
 * [can-connect/base/base.listSet]. This is used by other behaviors to lookup instances that should have changes applied.
 * Two examples, when there is a new instance that should be added to a list ([can-connect/real-time/real-time]) or
 * when newer data is available for a cached instance that is used in the page
 * ([can-connect/fall-through-cache/fall-through-cache]).
 *
 * Below you can see how `constructor-store`'s behavior be used to prevent multiple instances from being generated. This
 * example allows you to create multiple instances of a `todoEditor` that loads and edits a todo instance:
 *
 * @demo demos/can-connect/constructor-store.html
 *
 * You can see in this example that you can edit one todo and the other todos update.  This is because each `todoEditor`
 * is acting on same instance in memory. When it updates the todo's name here:
 *
 * ```
 * var updateData = function(newName) {
 *   todo.name = newName; // update name on todo instance
 *   ...
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * The other widgets update because they are bound to the same instance:
 *
 * ```
 * todo.on("name", updateElement); // when todo name changes update input element
 * todosConnection.addInstanceReference(todo); // previous line is a new usage of todo, so increase reference count
 * ```
 *
 * Each `todoEditor` receives the same instance because it was added to the
 * [can-connect/constructor/store/store.instanceStore connnection.instanceStore] by
 * [can-connect/constructor/store/store.addInstanceReference]. During all instance retrievals, a connection using the
 * `constructor/store` behavior checks the [can-connect/constructor/store/store.instanceStore] for an instance with a
 * matching `id` and return that if it exists. This example always requests `id: 5`, so all the `todoEditor`s use the
 * same instance held in the [can-connect/constructor/store/store.instanceStore].
 *
 * This widget cleans itself up when it is removed by removing the listener on the `todo` instance and
 * [can-connect/constructor/store/store.deleteInstanceReference reducing the instance reference count]:
 *
 * ```
 * todo.off("name", updateElement); // stop listening to todo name change
 * todosConnection.deleteInstanceReference(todo); // previous line removed a usage of todo, so reduce reference count
 * ```
 * This is done to prevent a memory leak produced by keeping instances in the `instanceStore` when they are no longer
 * needed by the application.
 *
 * **Note:** a hazard of sharing the same instance is that if new instance data is loaded from the server during
 * on-going editing of the instance, the new server data will replace the data that is edited but not yet saved.
 * This is because whenever data is loaded from the server, it is passed to
 * [can-connect/constructor/constructor.updatedInstance] which updates the shared instance properties with the new
 * server data.

		 * ```
		 * // a basic connection

		 * var constructor = require("can-connect/constructor/");
		 * var dataUrl = require("can-connect/data/url/");
		 * var todoConnection = connect([dataUrl, constructorStore, constructor], {

		 *   // add it to the store
		 *   todoConnection.addInstanceReference(todo);
		 *   originalTodo = todo;
		 * });
		 * ```
		 *
		 * Now, if you were to retrieve the same data sometime later, it would be the same instance:
		 *
		 * ```
		 * todoConnection.get({id: 5}).then(function( todo ){
		 *   todo === originalTodo // true
		 * });
		 * ```
		 *
		 * The `.getData` response data (underlying the call to `todoConnection.get`) is passed, along with the existing todo
		 * instance (`originalTodo`) to [can-connect/constructor/constructor.updatedInstance]. That updates the shared
		 * instance with the newly retrieved data.
		 *
		 * All the referenced instances are held in memory.  Use
		 * [can-connect/constructor/store/store.deleteInstanceReference] to remove them.
		 *

		 * as an event binding, and `deleteInstanceReference` is called when the interest is removed.
