 *
 * @signature `combineRequests( baseConnection )`
 *
 * Implements [can-connect/data/combine-requests.getListData] to collect the requested sets for some
 * [can-connect/data/combine-requests.time].  Once the configured amount of time has passed, it tries to take the
 * [can-connect/data/combine-requests.unionPendingRequests union] of the requested sets. It then makes requests with
 * those unified sets. Once the unified set requests have returned, the original requests are resolved by taking
 * [can-connect/data/combine-requests.getSubset subsets] of the unified response data.
 *
 * @param {{}} baseConnection `can-connect` connection object that is having the `combine-requests` behavior added
 * on to it. Should already contain a behavior that provides `getListData` (e.g [can-connect/data/url/url]). If
 * the `connect` helper is used to build the connection, the behaviors will automatically be ordered as required.
 *
 * @return {{}} a `can-connect` connection containing the method implementations provided by `combine-requests`.
 *
 * @body
 *
 * ## Use
 *
 * Create a connection with the `combine-requests` plugin:
 *
 * ```
 * var combineRequests = require("can-connect/data/combine-requests/");
 * var dataUrl = require("can-connect/data/url/");
 * var todosConnection = connect([dataUrl, combineRequests], {
 *   url: "/todos"
 * });
 * ```
 * Since the configuration above doesn't include the [can-connect/data/combine-requests.time] option, the following
 * will only make a single request if all requests are made during the same "thread of execution" (i.e. before the
 * browser takes a break from executing the current JavaScript):
 *
 * ```
 * todosConnection.getListData({})
 * todosConnection.getListData({userId: 5});
 * todosConnection.getListData({userId: 5, type: "critical"});
 * ```
 *
 * The above requests can all be joined since [can-set] intuitively knows that
 * `{userId: 5, type: "critical"}` and `{userId: 5}` are subsets of the complete set of todos, `{}`.
 *
 * For more advanced combining, a [can-set.Algebra set algebra] must be configured. This allows [can-set] to understand
 * what certain parameters of a set mean, and how they might be combined.
 *
 * The following connection supports combining ranges:
 *
 * ```
 * var set = require("can-set");
 * var combineRequests = require("can-connect/data/combine-requests/");
 * var dataUrl = require("can-connect/data/url/");
 * var todosConnection = connect([dataUrl, combineRequests], {
 *   url: "/todos",
 *   algebra: new set.Algebra(set.props.rangeInclusive("start","end"))
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Now the following will also be unified to make single request:
 *
 * ```
 * todosConnection.getListData({start: 0, end: 49})
 * todosConnection.getListData({start: 0, end: 5});
 * todosConnection.getListData({start: 50, end: 99});
 * ```
 *

		 * @function can-connect/data/combine-requests.unionPendingRequests unionPendingRequests
		 * @parent can-connect/data/combine-requests.algebra
		 *
		 * Group pending requests by the request that they are a subset of.
		 *
		 * @signature `connection.unionPendingRequests( pendingRequests )`
		 *
		 * This is called by [can-connect/data/combine-requests.getListData] to determine which pending requests can be unified
		 * into a broader request. This produces a grouping of 'parent' sets to 'child' requests whose data will be
		 * derived from the data retrieved by the parent.
		 *
		 * After this grouping is returned, [can-connect/data/combine-requests.getListData] executes requests for the parent
		 * sets. After a parent request succeeds, the child requests will have their data calculated from the parent data.
		 *
		 * @param {Array<can-connect/data/combine-requests.PendingRequest>} pendingRequests
		 * an array of objects, each containing:

		 *   - `set` - the set to request
		 *   - `pendingRequests` - the array of [can-connect/data/combine-requests.PendingRequest pending requests] the `set` satisfies
		 *
		 * ### Example
		 *
		 * This function converts something like:
		 *
		 * ```
		 * [
		 *   {set: {completed: false}, deferred: def1},
		 *   {set: {completed: true}, deferred: def2}
		 * ]
		 * ```

		 * ```
		 * [
		 *   {
		 *    set: {},
		 *    pendingRequests: [
		 *      {set: {completed: false}, deferred: def1},
		 *      {set: {completed: true}, deferred: def2}
		 *    ]
		 *   }
		 * ]
		 * ```
