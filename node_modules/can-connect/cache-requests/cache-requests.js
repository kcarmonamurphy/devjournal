 * @group can-connect/cache-requests/cache-requests.algebra algebra
 *
 * Cache response data and use it to prevent unnecessary future requests or make future requests smaller.
 *
 * @signature `cacheRequests( baseConnection )`
 *
 *   Provide an implementation of [can-connect/cache-requests/cache-requests.getListData] that uses set logic to
 *   determine what data is already in the [can-connect/base/base.cacheConnection cache] and what data needs to be
 *   loaded from the base connection.
 *
 *   It then gets data from the cache and the base connection (if needed), merges it, and returns it. Any data returned
 *   from the base connection is added to the cache.
 *
 *   @param {{}} baseConnection `can-connect` connection object that is having the `cache-requests` behavior added
 *   on to it. Should already contain the behaviors that provide the [can-connect/DataInterface]
 *   (e.g [can-connect/data/url/url]). If the `connect` helper is used to build the connection, the behaviors will
 *   automatically be ordered as required.
 *
 *   @return {Object} A `can-connect` connection containing the methods provided by `cache-requests`.
 *
 *
 * @body
 *
 * ## Use
 *
 * Use `cache-requests` in combination with a cache like [can-connect/data/memory-cache/memory-cache] or
 * [can-connect/data/localstorage-cache/localstorage-cache].  For example, to make it so response data is cached
 * in memory:
 *
 * ```
 * var memoryCache = require("can-connect/data/memory-cache/");
 * var dataUrl = require("can-connect/data/url/");
 * var cacheRequests = require("can-connect/cache-requests/");
 *
 * var cacheConnection = connect([memoryCache], {});
 * var todoConnection = connect([dataUrl, cacheRequests],{
 *   cacheConnection: cacheConnection,
 *   url: "/todos"
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Now if today's todos are loaded:
 *
 * ```
 * todoConnection.getListData({due: "today"});
 * ```
 *
 * And later, a subset of those todos are loaded:
 *
 * ```
 * todoConnection.getListData({due: "today", status: "critical"});
 * ```
 *
 * The subset will be created from the original request's data.
 *
 * ## Algebra Usage
 *
 * `cache-requests` can also "fill in" the data the cache is missing if you provide it the necessary [can-set set algebra].
 *
 * For example, if you requested paginated data like:
 *
 * ```
 * todoConnection.getListData({start: 1, end: 10})
 * ```
 *
 * And then later requested:
 *
 * ```
 * todoConnection.getListData({start: 1, end: 20})
 * ```
 *
 * ... with the appropriate algebra configuration, `cache-requests` will only request `{start: 11, end: 20}`, merging
 * that response with the data already present in the cache.
 *
 * That configuration looks like:
 *
 * ```
 * var algebra = new set.Algebra( set.props.rangeInclusive("start","end") );
 *
 * var cacheConnection = connect([memoryCache], {algebra: algebra});
 * var todoConnection = connect([dataUrl, cacheRequests], {
 *   cacheConnection: cacheConnection,
 *   url: "/todos",
 *   algebra: algebra
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * **Note:** `cacheConnection` shares the same algebra configuration as the primary connection.

		 *   If `set` has an intersection with one or more `availableSets`, a description of the difference that has the fewest
